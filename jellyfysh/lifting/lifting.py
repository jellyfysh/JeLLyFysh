    """
    Abstract class for a lifting scheme used in the event handlers.

    Event handlers with more than two independent units require a lifting scheme to compute their our-states. For this,
    the event handler prepares factor derivatives of relevant time-sliced units. Then it can fill the derivative table
    stored within this class via the insert method. The get_active_identifier method, which should be implemented by the
    inheriting class, then determines the next active identifier based on the derivative table. The reset method
    deletes the derivative table.
    This class is suited for a single active independent unit.

            The global state identifier of the unit.
        is_active : bool

        ------
