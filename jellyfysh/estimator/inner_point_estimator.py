class InnerPointEstimator(Estimator):
    """
    Estimator which compares the space derivatives along the direction of one of the cartesian axes for separations
    evenly distributed in the given region.

    This estimator is implemented for a factor potential between two point masses (of which one is active)
    which gets exactly one separation in the derivative method. The potential may further expect 0 or 2 charges. For the
    latter case, these charges are the ones of the active and the target point mass. The charge of the active point mass
    is set to 1.0 during the estimation of the bounds. The charge of the target point mass can be set on initialization.

    Per default, this estimator only uses the primary image separation, that means that the separations in the given
    region are corrected for periodic boundaries.

        The constructor of the InnerPointEstimator class.

        If the given region has the dimension D, then the total number of compared points is simply
        points_per_side ** D.

        If the potential expects two charges and the target_charge argument is not given, the charge 1.0 is used during
        the estimation of the bounds.

        Parameters
        ----------
        potential : potential.Potential
            Potential whose derivative is to be bounded.
        prefactor : float, optional
            A constant which gets multiplied to the bounds.
        empirical_bound : float, optional
            If a bound exceeds this value, this value will be returned instead.
        points_per_side : int, optional
            Specifies, into how many parts in each direction the given region for the separations in the
            derivative_bound method  is cut.
        target_charge : float, optional
            The charge of the target point mass.
        periodic_boundaries : bool
            Whether the separations in the given region should be corrected for periodic boundaries.

        Raises
        ------
        base.exceptions.ConfigurationError
            If the potential derivative method does not expect exactly one separation.
            If the potential derivative method does not expect 0 or 2 charges.
            If a value for the target charge was specified but the potential derivative method does not expect any.
