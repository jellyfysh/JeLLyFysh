class DipoleInnerPointEstimator(Estimator):
    """
    Estimator which compares the space derivatives along the direction of one of the cartesian axes for separations to
    dipoles evenly distributed in the given region.

    This estimator is implemented for a factor potential between point masses in two composite point objects. Only one
    point mass is active, and the target composite point object is approximated as a dipole. The charges of the point
    masses in the target composite point object should sum up to 0.0.

    The derivative method of the potential should expect exactly one separation and two charges.
    The estimator places at each evenly distributed point a dipole center. At this point, it calculates the gradient of
    the derivative and aligns the dipole with a given dipole separation along the direction of this gradient. The
    derivative is calculated by summing the two derivatives for the two point masses in the dipoles. Here, these point
    masses have opposite charges with an absolute value that is given on initialization. The charge of the active point
    mass is set to 1.0 during the estimation of the bounds.

    Per default, this estimator only uses the primary image separation, that means that the separations in the given
    region are corrected for periodic boundaries.

        """
        Estimate an upper and an optional lower bound of the potential's space derivative along the given direction
        between a minimum and maximum corner of a given region for the possible separations.

        This method extends the derivative_bound method of the Estimator class.

        The region is covered evenly in each direction in a number of steps which is set on initialization. At each
        point, this estimator creates a dipole with the orientation aligned to the gradient of the potential's
        derivative at this point. The dipole has a separation and charges that were set on initialization. The upper
        (lower) bound is then the maximum (minimum) of the sum of the derivatives with respect to the positions of the
        two point masses, again corrected by the prefactor and the empirical bound.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lower_corner : Sequence[float]
            Lower corner of the region to be estimated. The length of the tuple agrees with system dimensions.
