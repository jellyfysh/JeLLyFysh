class DipoleMonteCarloEstimator(Estimator):
    """
    Estimator which compares the space derivatives along the direction of one of the cartesian axes for separations to
    dipoles randomly distributed in the given region.

    This estimator is implemented for a factor potential between point masses in two composite point objects. Only one
    point mass is active, and the target composite point object is approximated as a dipole. The charges of the point
    masses in the target composite point object should sum up to 0.0.

    The derivative method of the potential should expect exactly one separation and two charges.
    The estimator places random points as the dipole center and constructs a dipole for a random orientation. The point
    masses within this dipole then have opposite charges with the absolute value being the maximum charge which is set
    in the initialize method. The charge of the active point mass is set to 1.0 during the estimation of the bounds.
    The derivative between the active point mass and the dipole is then computed by summing two derivatives between the
    active point mass and the target point masses in the dipole.

    Per default, this estimator only uses the primary image separation, that means that the separations in the given
    region are corrected for periodic boundaries.

        Estimate an upper and an optional lower bound of the potential's space derivative along the given direction
        between a minimum and maximum corner of a given region for the possible separations.

        This method extends the derivative_bound method of the Estimator class.

        The region is covered randomly by creating dipoles at random positions with a random orientation. The dipole has
        a separation and charges that were set on initialization. The upper (lower) bound is then the maximum (minimum)
        of the differences of the sum of the derivatives with respect to the positions of the two point masses, again
        corrected by the prefactor and the empirical bound.

            Lower corner of the region to be estimated. The length of the tuple agrees with system dimensions.
