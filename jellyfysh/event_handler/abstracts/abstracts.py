    """
    The most basic abstract event handler classes for in-states built from the TreeStateHandler.

    This class is designed to work together with the TreeStateHandler. Here, the in-states are branches of cnodes
    containing units. Also, the event handlers are responsible for keeping the time-slicing of composite objects and
    its point masses consistent.

    This class provides methods to store the in-state, to time-slice an unit and to time-slice all units present on all
    cnodes in the in-state.

    Note that in order to avoid loss of precision during long runs of JF, candidate event times and time stamps of
    active units are not stored as simple floats but as the quotient and remainder of an integer division of the time
    with 1 (see base.time.Time class for more information).

    ----------
