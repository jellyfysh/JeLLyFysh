class LeafUnitCellVetoEventHandler(CellVetoEventHandler):
    """
    Event handler which treats a two-leaf-unit interaction using the cell-veto algorithm.

    This class is designed to work together with the TreeStateHandler. Here, the in-states are branches of cnodes
    containing units. Also, the event handlers are responsible for keeping the time-slicing of composite objects and
    its point masses consistent.

    Only a single leaf unit should be active with an direction of motion in positive direction along an axis.
    The base class sets up and uses Walker's algorithm to sample a target cell and a candidate event time. The target
    cell is sampled under consideration of periodic boundary conditions.

    This class is used, when the relevant cell-occupancy system stores point masses. The out-state can be calculated by
    exchanging the velocities of the two leaf units after the confirmation of the event.

    This event handler can consider the charge of the active leaf unit by using the charge correction factor of the
    estimator that is used to estimate upper and lower bounds on the derivative for any non-nearby cell separation. The
    name of the used charge is set on initialization.

    Note that in order to avoid loss of precision during long runs of JF, candidate event times and time stamps of
    active units are not stored as simple floats but as the quotient and remainder of an integer division of the time
    with 1 (see base.time.Time class for more information).

        Initialize this event handler.

        be called without raising an error.

        ----------
        cells : activator.internal_state.cell_occupancy.cells.PeriodicCells
