class SingleIndependentActivePeriodicDirectionEndOfChainEventHandler(EndOfChainEventHandler):
    """
    Event handler which ends an event chain in fixed time intervals.

    This event handler aligns the velocity of a single independent active (root or leaf) unit periodically with the
    cartesian axes in the positive direction (e.g., in three dimensions x -> y -> z -> x -> ...), while keeping the
    entry in the velocity along the relevant axis constant. The send_out_state method therefore only succeeds if the
    current velocity of the independent active unit is also aligned to one of the cartesian axes (see _get_new_velocity
    method that raises an error otherwise). After an end-of-chain event of this event handler, a random unit is
    independent active. This unit is a leaf (root) unit if the independent active unit at the moment of the computation
    of the candidate event time of this event handler was also a leaf (root) unit. This implies that the end-of-chain
    event should be trashed and recomputed if the simulation switches from an independent active leaf to root unit.

    The instance of this event handler should always be active because it computes the new candidate event time based
    on the time of the previously committed event (i.e., based on the time of the last call of the send_out_state
    method).

    This class is designed to work together with the TreeStateHandler. Here, the in-states are branches of cnodes
    containing units. Also, the event handlers are responsible for keeping the time-slicing of composite objects and
    its point masses consistent.

    This class implements an EndOfChainEventHandler. For more details on the implementation of this event handler, see
    .abstracts.end_of_chain_event_handler.

    Note that in order to avoid loss of precision during long runs of JF, candidate event times and time stamps of
    active units are not stored as simple floats but as the quotient and remainder of an integer division of the time
    with 1 (see base.time.Time class for more information). The chain time that is added to the old candidate event
    time, however, can stay a simple float because it is always of the same order of magnitude during a run of JF.

        Return the candidate event time together with the identifiers of the units that should become independent

        The in-state should contain the branches of all independent active units (i.e., the active global state). This
        event handler only allows for a single independent active unit.

        Parameters
        ----------
        root_cnodes_of_independent_active_units : Sequence[base.node.Node]
            The active global state.

        In the out-state, the previously independent active unit has a zero velocity and the new independent active

        This class stores the time stamp of the (currently) independent active unit. This is used in the
        _get_new_chain_time method to achieve an end-of-chain event in fixed intervals of the chain time even when
        end-of-chain events are trashed.

        cnodes_with_active_units : Sequence[base.node.Node]

        cnodes_with_new_active_units : Sequence[base.node.Node]
