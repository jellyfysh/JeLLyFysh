class TwoLeafUnitEventHandler(SingleActiveLeafUnitEventHandler):
    """
    Event handler which uses an invertible potential as the interaction between two leaf units.

    This class is designed to work together with the TreeStateHandler. Here, the in-states are branches of cnodes
    containing units. Also, the event handlers are responsible for keeping the time-slicing of composite objects and
    its point masses consistent.

    Only one of the two leaf units should be active. This class uses an potential which expects a single separation
    between two leaf units. The separation vector between the interacting leaf units is corrected for periodic
    boundaries.

    If the potential can consider charges, this event handler can pass the charges of the two leaf units to the
    potential. The name of the used charge is set on initialization.

    This event handler only samples a potential change that is passed to the displacement method of the potential, if
    the potential requires a potential change (some potentials as, e.g., the Hard-Sphere potential do not require a
    sampled potential change).

    Note that in order to avoid loss of precision during long runs of JF, candidate event times and time stamps of
    active units are not stored as simple floats but as the quotient and remainder of an integer division of the time
    with 1 (see base.time.Time class for more information). The time displacements returned by the potential's
    displacement method, however, are still simple floats because they are always of the same order of magnitude during
    a run of JF.
