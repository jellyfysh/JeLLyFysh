class Potential(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    Abstract class for potentials used in the event handlers.

    A general potential only provides a method, which calculates the directional derivative along a given velocity
    vector of the active unit. The potentials in JFV can depend on several separations (between the active and target
    units) and charges. Note that, for the case of periodic boundaries, periodicity is not taken into account by the
    potentials but by the event handlers which use these potentials. An exception are merged-image potentials.

        """
        The constructor of the Potential class.

        This class defines the number_separation_arguments and number_charge_arguments properties which use the
        corresponding self._number_separation_arguments and self._number_charge_arguments attributes. These properties
        return the number of separation and charge arguments, respectively, that the derivative method expects. They
        are used by event handlers to check whether the potential has the expected form. An inheriting class should
        initialize the private properties to the correct values. If they are not set, this class tries to initialize the
        number of separation and charge arguments of the derivative method by inspecting the argument names of this
        method (see _inspect_number_separation_and_charge_arguments method). For this to work, each separation argument
        should begin with 'separation' and similarly each charge argument should begin with 'charge'.

        This class is designed for cooperative inheritance, meaning that it passes through all unused kwargs in the
        init to the next class in the MRO via super.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prefactor : float, optional
            A general multiplicative prefactor of the potential.
        kwargs : Any
            Additional kwargs which are passed to the __init__ method of the next class in the MRO.

        Raises
        ------
        base.exceptions.ConfigurationError

    def __init__(self, prefactor: float = 1.0, **kwargs: Any) -> None:

        The constructor of the InvertiblePotential class.

        This class defines the potential_change_required property that uses the corresponding
        self._potential_change_required attribute. This property determines whether the displacement method expects
        a potential change argument, and is used by event handlers to check whether a potential change is sampled or

        prefactor : float, optional
            A general multiplicative prefactor of the potential.

        """
        Return the required time displacement of the active unit along its velocity where the cumulative event rate of
        the potential equals the given potential change.

        How a movement of the active unit induces a change of the separation should be clearly indicated in the
        inheriting invertible potential so that the event handler which uses this potential is implemented in the right
        way.

        Note that some potentials do not require a potential change because they contain infinite large steps (e.g., the
        hard-sphere potential). Thus, the potential change argument is only optional.

        When overwriting this method, each separation should appear as its own argument. The same is true for the

        charge arguments. If the real number of arguments is equal to this minimum number of expected arguments, it is
