    This class implements the invertible hard dipole potential.

    The potential between the two involved units only vanishes if the absolute value of their separation lies in between
    a minimum value r and a maximum value R: U_ij = 0 if r <= |r_ij| <= R, U_ij = inf otherwise. Here, r_ij = r_j - r_i

        Parameters
        ----------
        velocity : Sequence[float]
            The velocity of the active unit.
        separation : Sequence[float]

    def gradient(self, separation: Sequence[float]) -> Sequence[float]:
        """
        Return the gradient of the potential evaluated at the given separation.

        The hard-dipole potential can be written as U(r_ij) = a * (Theta(r - |r_ij|) + Theta(|r_ij| - R)) with a=inf.
        The derivative with respect to x_i, for example, is thus given by
        a * (x_j - x_i) / |r_ij| * (delta(r - |r_ij|) - delta(|r_ij| - R)). Therefore, the gradient of this potential
        vanishes everywhere, except at |r_ij| = r where it is infinite and |r_ij|, where it is negative infinity. This
        method asserts that the given separation has a norm of r or R. If so, even though the gradient is infinite, it
        still returns the separation vector itself, which points in the same direction as the gradient at |r_ij| = r and
        in the opposite direction ar |r_ij| = R. This result is sufficient to change the velocity in an event in, e.g.,
        reflective ECMC, and should only be used for that.

        Parameters
        ----------
        separation : Sequence[float]
            The separation vector r_ij.

        Returns
        -------
        Sequence[float]
            The gradient with respect to the position r_i of the active unit.

        Return the directional time derivative along a given velocity vector of the active unit for the given
        separation.

        This derivative vanishes everywhere, except at |r_ij| = r and |r_ij| = R. However, this derivative should not be
        used within ECMC. Thus, this method raises an error.

        Parameters
        ----------
        velocity : Sequence[float]
            The velocity of the active unit along which the directional derivative is computed.
        separation : Sequence[float]
            The separation vector |r_ij| between the active and target unit.
