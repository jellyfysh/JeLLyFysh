    """
    This class implements a cell bounding potential.

    This potential only allows for standard velocities (i.e., velocities parallel to one of the cartesian coordinate
    axes going in the positive direction) of the active unit.

    It uses an estimator in order to determine upper and lower bounds for the derivatives for possible cell separations.
    Since in this version of JeLLyFysh, cell separations are only defined for periodic cell systems (i.e., with taking
    periodic boundary conditions into account), this class can only be initialized with an instance of the
    'PeriodicCells' class (see 'initialize' method). The upper and lower bounds for the derivatives are determined for
    all cell separations which are not excluded in the cell system.

    This bounding potential can be used with any number of point masses involved in the factor (e.g., pair factors
    involving two point masses or molecular factors involving all point masses of two composite point objects), and for
    any number of active point masses. The used estimator must just be suited for the factor treated in the event
    handler that uses this cell bounding potential.

        Return the required displacement in space of the active unit along the positive direction of motion parallel to
        one of the cartesian axes where the cumulative event rate of the potential equals the given potential change.

        This method first computes the bounding event rate by using the stored derivative bounds of the estimator, and
        the multiplicative correction factor returned by the estimator based on the charges of the active point masses
        and the target point masses. The relevant bound is the upper bound if the correction factor is greater than zero
        and the lower bound otherwise.
        The displacement is then just the potential change divided by the constant bounding event rate.
        This method might return a displacement which places the active unit out of its cell which changes the cell
        separation. However, this is not relevant because a cell boundary event should be triggered before.

        If there is only a single active and/or target point mass, the single charge should be given as a float.
        Otherwise the charges should be given as tuples.

        Parameters
        ----------
        direction : int
            The direction of motion of the active unit.

        This method replaces the standard_velocity_displacement method, if this class was initialized without storing
