    A cell is determined by a minimum and maximum position that belong to it. Here, the minimum position is guaranteed
    to be smaller than the maximum position in each dimension. A cell is also associated with an identifier that can
    be used by a cell system (see Cells class below). The specific form of these (integer, tuple...) is left open so
    they are of type Any in this class.

    (see 'PeriodicCells' class) defines a cell separation via the 'relative_cell' method.

        The direction indicates the axis along which the neighbor is returned and should satisfy

        positive direction. Otherwise, it returns the neighbor in the negative direction.
        In a non periodic setting, the neighbor might be None.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cell : Cell
            The cell whose neighbor is returned
        direction : int
            The direction in which the neighbor is returned.
        positive : bool
            Whether this method returns the neighbor along the positive or negative direction.

        Returns
        -------
        Cell or None
            The neighbor cell in the given positive or negative direction, or None if the neighbor cell does not exist.
