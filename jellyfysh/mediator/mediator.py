    The abstract base class of a mediator in the JF application.

    The mediator serves as a central hub for other elements of JF that do not directly connect to each other. In this
    way, interfaces and data exchange are particularly simple.
    The mediator connects to the input-output handler, the state handler, the scheduler, and the activator. The
    activator stores the list of all event handlers (but there shouldn't be a data flow between them, only the mediator
    should call methods of the event handlers) which also gets extracted in this class.
    The mediator also serves as an entry point for the executable run.py and resume.py scripts of this application.
    This class defines the needed methods for this.

    The abstract Mediator class which defines mediating methods.

    This class inherits from the MediatorAbstractClass. In this class mediating methods and methods to construct

    The mediating methods are called when an event of an event handler was committed to the global state. It should
    begin with 'mediate_' and followed by the name of the event handler class. The mediating methods don't have
    any arguments and their return value is None.
    The other method, which constructs arguments for the send_out_state method of an event handler, follows the same
    naming convention but the start is 'get_arguments_'. The objects in the sequence returned besides the
    candidate event time in the send_event_time of an event handler, will be handed to the argument construction
    method (the sequence gets unpacked). The returned object of this method also gets unpacked and is then handed to
    the send_out_state method. Methods which only return a single object, should probably put it into a tuple
    explicitly for this reason.
    Both methods can also be defined for base classes, however only a single base class should then define either of
    these methods.
