class NewtonianTreeStateHandler(StateHandler):
    """
    The tree state handler uses a tree structure to implement the abstract methods of a state handler.

    It separates the global state into the global physical state and the global lifting state. The global physical
    state stores all positions of point masses and composite point objects in a tree, where each node contains a
    base.particle.Particle object (see TreePhysicalState). This object contains the time-sliced position, and possibly
    a charge (only for the leaf nodes).

    Root nodes can be iterated and they have a unique numbering. The children of each root node are also numbered.
    This implies unique identifiers of nodes and their particles as tuples of integers with different lengths (see
    StateId). The first entry gives the root node, followed by the entries on lower levels.

    The global lifting state maps such identifiers onto a velocity and the time stamp of the last time slicing (see
    TreeLiftingState). In order to avoid loss of precision during long runs of JF, time stamps (and candidate event
    times) are not stored as simple floats but as the quotient and remainder of an integer division of the time stamp
    with 1 (see base.time.Time class for more information).

    When the tree state handler communicates with other parts of the application via its method, it combines the
    global physical and the global lifting state in base.unit.Unit objects. Here, positions, velocities, and time stamps
    are copied so that other parts of JF can modify them without modifying the global state.

    As a design principle, the event handlers keep the time-slicing of composite point objects and its point masses
    consistent. Therefore the parts of the tree structure needs to be mirrored as well. For a given identifier, the
    tree state handler constructs branches, that is the information of a node with its ancestors and descendants,
    where each node contains a unit. Such nodes are called cnodes in variables and docstrings to distinguish them from
    nodes which contain particles.
