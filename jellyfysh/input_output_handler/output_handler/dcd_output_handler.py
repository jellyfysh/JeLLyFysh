class DcdOutputHandler(MDAnalysisOutputHandler):
    """
    Output handler which writes the trajectory of the leaf units in the extracted global state into a .dcd file.

    This output handler should receive the extracted global state in its write method. It is designed to work together
    with the TreeStateHandler. Here, the extracted global state is given by a sequence of trees. Each tree is specified
    by a root node, which themselves are connected to children nodes. Each node contains a Unit object.
    This output handler allows for a variable number of root nodes, each with the same number of children. For each
    leaf node, the names of the corresponding point masses can be given on initialization of this class. The same is
    true for the bonds of leaf nodes of a single root node.

    This output handler stores the subsequent positions of the leaf units in the extracted global states of each call
    of the write method in a single trajectory in the .dcd file. The first call of the write method further uses the
    PdbOutputHandler to store the topology of the extracted global state (i.e., the connections of the leaf units) in a
    .pdb file.  For this, the same filename with exchanged file suffixes is used.
    Note that the positions of point masses are corrected for periodic boundary conditions so that they are the closest
    to the position of the composite point object they belong to.
    The writing to .dcd files can only be used if the hypercuboid setting is initialized and in at most three
    dimensions (see MDAnalysisOutputHandler class).

        The constructor of the DcdOutputHandler class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            The filename of the file this output handler is connected to.
        names_within_composite_object : Sequence[str], optional

            The sequence of bonds of the point masses within the composite object. In the sequence, the bonds should be

            node.

        base.exceptions.ConfigurationError
